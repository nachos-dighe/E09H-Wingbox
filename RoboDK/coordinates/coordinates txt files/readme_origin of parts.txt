The origin point is taken as follows:

top/bottom panels: corner touching the LONG EDGE and NON-SLANTED EDGE
side panel: corner touching the LONG EDGE and NON-SLANTED EDGE
side stringer: Part is symmetric, so corner on the NON-BENT side 
all other stringers: corner that algins with NON-BENT side and side that aligns with the nearest hole to non-slanted edge
